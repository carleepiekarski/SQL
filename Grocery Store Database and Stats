CREATE TABLE clothing(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,name TEXT, price INTEGER, color TEXT, material TEXT);
INSERT into clothing VALUES(1,"Pants",4,"blue","jean");
INSERT into clothing VALUES(2,"Shirts",5,"pink","cotton");
INSERT into clothing VALUES(3,"Bras",2,"purple","cotton");
INSERT into clothing VALUES(4,"Hats",3,"Black","synthetic");
INSERT into clothing VALUES(5,"Socks",4,"White","cotton");
INSERT into clothing VALUES(6,"Underwear",2,"purple","cotton");
INSERT into clothing VALUES(7,"Sweater",5,"Green","Synthetic");
