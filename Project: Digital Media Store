--In this project I reviewed and analyzed data relating to a digital media store. I attempted to combine all of my knowledge of SQL into this project. 
#These are the questioned I aimed to answer: 

--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName, 
LastName,
CustomerId,
Country
FROM customers

--Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT customerID

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

c.LastName,
i.InvoiceId,
i.InvoiceDate,
i.BillingCountry
FROM customers as c
INNER JOIN invoices as i
ON c.CustomerId=i.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country= "Brazil";

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName,
LastName
FROM employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

e.FirstName,

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.invoiceid
