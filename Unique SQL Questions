# In this assignment I examined data from a database containing information on safety rating for bike lanes. 
#The goal was to pretend I was hired to create a table that showed the bike lanes by street, safety rating,
average safety rating, and a reccomendation.

with the actual average rating and a label that says "Safe Lane"
