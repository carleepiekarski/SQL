#In this project I used amazon prime title data to create my own set of 10 
questions. These are the questions I aimed to answer: 

--How many movies are included in the dataset?
SELECT count(type) 
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles 
WHERE type= 'Movie';

--How many TV shows are included in the dataset?
SELECT count(type) 
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles 
WHERE type= 'TV Show';

--What is the title of the movie with the longest duration?
SELECT title, MAX(duration) as longest_duration,type 
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE type= 'Movie'
GROUP BY duration
ORDER BY title
LIMIT 1;

--Who are the directors of the TV shows with a 13+ rating?
SELECT director, type, rating
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE type= 'TV Show'
AND rating= '13+'
AND director <> " ";

--Which country has the most titles available on Amazon Prime?
SELECT distinct country, COUNT(distinct title) 
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE country <> ' '
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY title desc
LIMIT 1;

--How many titles were added on March 30, 2021?
SELECT count(title), 
date_added
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE date_added = "30-Mar-21"
AND length(date_added)=8;

--What is the average release year of the movies in the dataset?
SELECT AVG(release_year),
type
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE type = 'Movie';

--Which genre(s) are associated with the movie "The Grand Seduction"?
SELECT listed_in as genre,
title
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE title= "The Grand Seduction";

--List the title and movie descriptions of movies made in 2017.
SELECT type,
title, 
description,
release_year
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE type= 'Movie'
AND release_year= '2017';

--Which movie has the shortest duration?
SELECT title,
type,
MIN(duration) 
FROM chinook0.amazon_prime_titles
WHERE duration <> '0 min'
AND type= 'Movie'
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY duration asc
LIMIT 1;
